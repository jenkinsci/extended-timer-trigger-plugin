  Trigger runs based on a cron like schedule. You can use the regular Jenkins syntax but also an extended syntax.
  See the tables below for reference.<br/>
  The extended syntax has limited support for the <b>H</b> character. It can only be used standalone and not in combination with ranges or intervals.<br/>
  To specify a different timezone use<br/>
  <pre>TZ=Europe/London</pre>
  The timezone can appear anywhere in the list, also multiple times and applies to all following lines until a
  new timezone definition is found.<br/>
  To reset the TZ information to the controller timezone use
  <pre>TZ=</pre>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>?</td>
        <td>Stands for 'no specific value' and is allowed for the Day-of-Month and Day-of-Week fields. It is used
          instead of the asterisk (*) for leaving either Day-of-Month or Day-of-Week blank.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>Used to define ranges. E.g., <em>10-12</em> in the hour field means the hours of 10, 11, and 12.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>,</td>
        <td>Used to separate items in a list. E.g., <em>MON,WED,FRI</em> in the Day-of-Week field means the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>/</td>
        <td>Used to indicate increments. E.g. <em>0/20</em> in the minutes field means the seconds 0, 20 and 40.
          <em>1/4</em> in the Day-of-Month field means every 4 days starting on the first day of the month.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>L</td>
        <td>Short for "last" and can be used in the Day-of-Month and Day-of-Week fields. The <em>L</em> character has a different meaning in
          the two fields. In the Day-of-Month field, it means the last day of the month. In the Day-of-Week field, it means 6 or SAT.
          If used in the Day-of-Week field after a number, it means the last xxx day of the month. E.g., <em>6L</em> in the Day-of-Week field means
          the last Saturday of the month.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td>W</td>
        <td><em>W</em> Stands for "weekday" and is only allowed for the Day-of-Month field. The <em>W</em> character is used to specify the weekday nearest
          to the given day. E.g., <em>10W</em> in the Day-of-Month field means the nearest weekday to the 10th of the month. If the 10th is a Saturday,
          the job will run on Friday the 10th. <em>W</em> can be combined with <em>L</em> to <em>LW</em> and means last weekday of the month.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>#</td>
        <td>Can only be used in the Day-of-Week field. Used to specify constructs. E.g., <em>5#3</em> means the third Friday of the month.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>H</td>
        <td>Stands for a random value (based on the hash of the job name). Can be used in all fields except Day-of-Month.
          If used it must be the only value (intervals and ranges are not supported).</td>
